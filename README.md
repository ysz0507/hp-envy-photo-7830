# Nmap Dashboard and Scanning integration

This project is a simple dashboard for monitoring devices on my local network. It also integrates with the scanner unit of my **HP ENVY PHOTO 7830**, letting me scan documents directly to my Paperless instance. Scan requests can also be sent from an ESP-based "instant-scan" button. This makes it convenient for skipping the printerâ€™s clunky menu and streamlines the integration into paperless.

The dashboard is especially useful if your network often has new or changing devices. Every time you open it, an **Nmap scan** runs to detect open ports. Each open port is shown as a clickable box that forwards you to the corresponding device or service.

The website works well on both phones and desktops.
